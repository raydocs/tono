## Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raydocs/liquidclash.git tono
cd tono
open apps/macos/LiquidClash.xcodeproj
```

Build and run the macOS client with `⌘R` in Xcode. Requires macOS 26.0+ and
Xcode 26.0+. See `apps/windows/README.md` for Windows prerequisites and build
instructions.

## Branch and release ownership

macOS work is released from `release/macos`, Windows work from
`release/windows`, and both are merged normally into `main`. Only `main` may
deploy the shared production control plane. See
[`docs/RELEASE_LINES.md`](docs/RELEASE_LINES.md) for tag formats, immutable
legacy records, update-channel ownership, and merge gates.
