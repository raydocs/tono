/// Revision 7 replaces the three mutating PUT routes with POST. The pinned transport applies a
/// hidden two-attempt policy to PUT regardless of client configuration, which can replay a write
/// after the Service committed but its response was lost.
/// Revision 8 adds the mandatory verified-tunnel commit; accepting a revision 7 client would
/// leave a genuinely connected session indistinguishable from a stale first attempt on reboot.
/// Revision 9 is the Test 6 system-safety floor: lock-free status snapshots, strict DNS restore,
/// and the bounded Windows Service runtime ship as one inseparable App/Service contract.
/// Requiring it prevents a failed installer replacement from silently pairing the new App with
/// the older Test 5 Service that still has the original freeze/recovery semantics.
/// Revision 10 adds the mandatory fail-closed DIRECT runtime-reload bracket.
/// Revision 11 adds an authenticated pre-start orphan-core reconciliation. It must run before
/// the App probes loopback DNS so a Tono Core left by an interrupted upgrade cannot permanently
/// squat `127.0.0.1:53` and prevent the Service's existing safe reaper from ever being reached.
/// Revision 12 extends that contract to a Core the current Service still supervises or records:
/// only a completely verified fail-closed runtime may survive the preflight; an inactive Core is
/// stopped before its own DNS listener can strand every subsequent connection attempt.
/// Revision 13 adds GET/POST `/bootstrap-pins` so learned control-plane addresses persist under
/// the Service's ProgramData ACL. MIN_REQUIRED stays 12: an older Service is still safe, and the
/// App then keeps only the compiled pins.
