//! Network and power change monitoring for the Windows kill switch.
//!
//! `NotifyIpInterfaceChange` / `NotifyRouteChange2` callbacks and `SERVICE_CONTROL_POWEREVENT`
//! all funnel into one debounced (750 ms) event note. The service-side contract per
//! The kill-switch failure matrix is deliberately narrow: **the barrier stays** —
//! every event is recorded for `/status` reporting and the log, an armed kill switch stays
//! armed, and "Connected invalidated → reconnect behind the barrier" is the product layer's
//! job (it owns the UI `Connected` state; the service merely guarantees the fail-closed link
//! in the chain: event → invalidation signal → still blocking).
//!
//! **What this feed is not.** It answers "the machine's networking changed underneath us", so a
//! change *we* made is out of scope by definition. Writing an adapter's DNS servers is an
//! IP-interface parameter change, and this service writes them on every connect, every restore
//! and every DNS reconcile tick; publishing those callbacks made the product layer tear down
//! and rebuild a perfectly healthy tunnel every few seconds for ever. `raw_notify` therefore
//! drops — counts, but does not publish — any raw notification that arrives while the `dns`
//! module has a write window open ([`crate::core::dns::in_self_write_window`]). Suppression
//! applies to *arriving* callbacks only: a burst that was already pending when the window
//! opened still fires, so nothing observed before a write of ours is ever retracted.
