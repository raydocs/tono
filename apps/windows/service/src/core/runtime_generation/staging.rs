//! Making a runtime generation match a bundle without restarting the core that runs in it.
//!
//! A generation is normally written once, by `start_clash`, into a directory nothing else has
//! touched. Staging writes into a directory a core is *currently running in*, which changes what
//! is safe: files may be held open, and the core reads whatever it finds when it is told to
//! reload. Three rules follow, and the plan below exists to make them explicit rather than
//! implicit in the order of some I/O.
//!
//! **The service only deletes what it can prove it put there.** Every deletion candidate comes
//! from the previous manifest, never from listing the directory. The core creates files of its
//! own in the generation — `cache.db` at least — and a sweep driven by "whatever the bundle did
//! not declare" would delete a database the running core has open.
//!
//! **A remote provider's cache is stale exactly when its url changed.** The core will not
//! re-fetch a provider whose file already exists, so a cache left over from a different source
//! keeps being served until that provider's own interval elapses. Deleting it is therefore not
//! housekeeping: it has to happen before the core reloads, or the reload is silently wrong.
//!
//! **A copied asset is worth re-copying only when its source changed.** Comparing content would
//! mean hashing tens of megabytes of geo data on every profile switch, which is most of what
//! staging was supposed to save. The manifest records what each copy was made from instead.
