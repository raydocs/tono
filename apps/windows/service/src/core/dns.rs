//! Per-adapter DNS protection for the Windows kill switch.
//!
//! Snapshot every adapter's IPv4/IPv6 `NameServer`/`ProfileNameServer` → point IPv4 at Mihomo's
//! TUN-side DNS endpoint (`198.18.0.2`) and leave IPv6 with **no servers at all** → read back what
//! can be read back (evidence on the way in, a *gate* only on the way out) → restore from the
//! snapshot on disconnect. The snapshot (`protected-dns.json`) is
//! written atomically to the service state directory *before* any value is changed — the same
//! discipline as the kill-switch intent record.
//!
//! **Why IPv4 uses the TUN endpoint instead of the loopback listener.** Mihomo listens on
//! `127.0.0.1:53`, but with `strict-route` and `dns-hijack` a Windows resolver query addressed
//! there is reclassified during the loopback/TUN transition and does not reach the listener on
//! real machines. The pinned core publishes `198.18.0.2` as the DNS endpoint on the Tono
//! adapter; a real-machine probe proved that endpoint returns fake IPs while an explicit query
//! to `127.0.0.1` times out. Pointing adapters at the TUN endpoint also makes the security path
//! unambiguous: the query must traverse the permitted Tono interface, while WFP default-deny
//! blocks physical DNS.
//!
//! **Why IPv6 gets an empty server list and not `::1`.** Nothing listens on `[::1]:53`. A build
//! that pointed the IPv6 family at `::1` therefore configured a resolver
//! that never answers, and every system lookup that Windows tried over IPv6 first waited out
//! its full timeout: the fake-ip readiness probe failed three attempts at 2 s each and connect
//! died in `securingDNS` on a machine whose DNS was otherwise fine. Nothing was bought for it —
//! IPv6 DNS to a physical resolver is already *blocked* by WFP (the weight-6 `block-dns` filter
//! on `CONNECT_V6` plus the condition-free v6 block-all), so `::1` prevented no leak. The
//! protected IPv6 state is an empty **static** list ([`NO_NAME_SERVERS`]) — deliberately not
//! DHCP, which would hand the ISP's resolvers straight back and *would* be a leak — so Windows
//! falls through to the IPv4 TUN resolver, which answers. `::1` is still *recognised* as a
//! protected/loopback value everywhere on the proof path, because adapters left that way by an
//! older build must not read as restored.
//!
//! **The enable-time read-back is evidence, not a gate.** Applying protected DNS is a *write*;
//! proving it from Windows is not reliably possible. The registry stores "static, no servers"
//! and "use DHCP" identically (which is why the IPv6 leg of the read-back was already removed),
//! and the live apply runs through PowerShell/CIM/netsh, which fails on real machines for
//! reasons that have nothing to do with whether DNS works: pseudo-adapters, constrained language
//! mode, EDR hooks, a damaged WMI repository. Gating `enable` on that weak proof killed connects
//! on machines whose DNS was fine — the last one bailed with "protected DNS could not be verified
//! on every active adapter" at 1.1 s, *before* the strong proof ever ran. So `enable` now
//! **records** what it could not verify (per-adapter live-apply failures in the snapshot and in
//! [`LIVE_APPLY_FAILURES`]; the whole round in `DNS_LAST_ERROR` and therefore in the status
//! payload, behind [`DNS_PROTECTION_UNVERIFIED_PREFIX`]) and returns success, so the connect
//! reaches the proof that is actually direct: `verify_fake_ip` in the App resolves a name through
//! the OS and demands an answer in `198.18/16`. Nothing is traded away by demoting the weak
//! proof, because WFP default-denies DNS on the physical interfaces while its verified-TUN
//! permit admits the `198.18.0.2` path: a machine whose DNS configuration cannot be verified
//! cannot leak, it can only fail to resolve — and failing to resolve is exactly what the
//! fake-ip probe catches, with the recorded note in the status payload to say why. What stays a
//! hard failure of `enable` is the case where **no per-adapter
//! outcome exists at all** (the adapter enumeration or the apply batch itself errored, or the
//! record of the round could not be persisted): then there is nothing to restore, nothing to
//! reconcile, and nothing truthful to report.
//!
//! **DNS-before-disarm invariant (identical to the macOS helper):** the kill switch may only
//! disarm after DNS restore is *proven*; if restore cannot be proven, the disarm is refused
//! and the block stays armed. See `windows_kill_switch::disarm_unlocked`.
//!
//! **The one place that invariant is deliberately traded away is *uninstall*.** Refusing to
//! release while the product stays installed costs the user a retry; refusing at uninstall time
//! costs them an application they cannot remove, which is not an acceptable outcome for
//! consumer software. [`restore_for_uninstall`] is the escalation ladder that replaces the
//! single refusal there — exact restore, then automatic (DHCP), then refusal — and it is
//! reached only from the uninstaller. Read the block comment above `uninstall_restore_rung`
//! before changing it; nothing on the Disconnect / release / quit path goes through it.
//!
//! **Proof is read off the machine as it is now, never off history:** a restore is proven when
//! the registry read-back matches the snapshot exactly *and* a live read says that nothing on
//! the machine still resolves through a Tono-owned protected target. Per-adapter live-apply results are
//! still recorded (in memory and in the snapshot file) and a failed live-apply is still retried
//! once during restore, but a `live_apply_failed` bit from an earlier round is a reason to
//! *demand* that live evidence — never a veto over evidence that is already in. It used to be
//! a veto, and that is exactly how a machine whose resolvers were provably the user's own again
//! (`registry_match=true`) was refused release on a single stale failure while the degraded
//! exit below needs a streak of three that one click on Disconnect can never reach. Evidence
//! that cannot be obtained is *unproven*, never proven — fail-closed for the normal disarm,
//! while the emergency path stays the documented escape hatch (it logs and proceeds).
//!
//! **The live apply is per address family.** IPv4 goes through CIM
//! (`SetDNSServerSearchOrder`, an IPv4-only method), IPv6 through `netsh interface ipv6 set
//! dnsservers`, and each family is proven by its own live read-back. Merging both families into
//! one CIM call either fails on every adapter or silently drops the IPv6 address, which leaves
//! an IPv6 resolver leaking while the registry still reads "protected".
//!
//! **Degraded exit (`docs/wfp-kill-switch.md`):** a registry-only match is not accepted as a
//! normal restore — but it *is* accepted, once, after the live apply has failed
//! `DEGRADED_RESTORE_STREAK` rounds in a row and the registry read-back matches the snapshot
//! exactly. On a machine where PowerShell/CIM is structurally unavailable (constrained-language
//! mode, AppLocker, a broken WMI repository, an EDR blocking
//! `Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration`) the live proof can never succeed, and without this exit
//! Disconnect, Sign Out and Quit are refused forever — the Protected-Offline deadlock this
//! design explicitly prevents. The acceptance is never silent: it carries
//! `DNS_RESTORE_DEGRADED_PREFIX` in `last_error` and in the status payload. Everything short
//! of that stays fail-closed, because automatically opening WFP while the live resolver may
//! still point at a dead loopback server strands the machine in an ambiguous and often
//! unrecoverable network state.
//!
//! **Nothing here may hang, and nothing here may become permanently unsatisfiable.** Every
//! engine call is bounded and holds a single-writer claim (`bounded_dns_call`), so an
//! unreturning Dnscache/registry/loader call fails the operation instead of parking the DNS
//! operation lock for the lifetime of the service. And a `protected-dns.json` this build cannot
//! read is recovered from live evidence (`recover_unreadable_snapshot`) rather than turning
//! the disarm gate into a permanent lockout — but only when nothing on the machine still
//! resolves through a Tono-owned target. A *missing* snapshot is also evidence-checked: if an
//! adapter still contains `198.18.0.2`, neither a new enable nor disarm may reinterpret it as
//! the user's original DNS (`DNS_SNAPSHOT_MISSING_PREFIX`).
//!
//! The pure snapshot/merge/restore-decision logic in this file is platform-independent and
//! unit-tested on any host; the registry/CIM/netsh engine is compiled only on Windows.

// the machine's networking underneath us, so it must not be published as one.
//
// The window is opened by the two functions that actually write ([`engine_apply_protected`] and
// [`engine_apply_snapshot`]) and by nothing else. It deliberately does **not** cover the
// enumeration, the read-back or the cache flush, which are reads and are also the slowest part
// of an `enable` round: keeping them outside is what keeps the window narrow enough that a
// genuine change is very unlikely to land entirely inside it.
//
// **Concurrency.** No lock protects this state and none can: `netmon`'s reader runs on an
// IPHelper callback thread that must never block, and it is not a tokio context, so it cannot
// take `DNS_OPERATION` (the tokio mutex every apply already holds, which is what keeps the
// depth at one in practice). The state is therefore three atomics, read with a single pure
// decision function, and every race in it resolves toward *publishing* — never toward silence.
//
// **The window cannot stick on.** It is opened by an RAII guard whose `Drop` is the only writer
// that lowers the depth, so a panic, an early `?`, a timed-out `bounded_dns_call` or a dropped
// (cancelled) future all close it. `SELF_WRITE_MAX_WINDOW` is the belt-and-braces half: past
// that age an open window stops suppressing even if the depth were somehow leaked.
//

// audit that only a Windows machine can settle): with no notification there is nothing to
// suppress and the code is dead weight during a handful of milliseconds per connect.

// --- Uninstall-only escalation ladder ---
//
// **The design error this ladder corrects.** Everywhere else in this module, "refuse unless the
// network is provably restored" is right: the product is staying installed, the user can retry,
// and the App still has a way to open the block. At *uninstall* time the same rule produced an
// **unremovable application** — the machine that reported this could not get past
// `RemoveVergeService` because the live CIM/netsh apply was failing on one adapter, so the exact
// restore could never be proven and the NSIS macro aborted the whole uninstall, every time.
// Unremovable consumer software is a worse outcome than an inexact DNS configuration, and it is
// not a trade the user ever agreed to.
//
// The danger the old refusal was aimed at is real, but the aim was wrong. What must never
// happen is *removing the app while leaving persistent WFP filters armed* — a blocked machine
// with no software left to unblock it. Refusing the uninstall is not the only way to prevent
// that, and it is the way that costs the most: it leaves the user blocked **and** stuck.
// `windows_kill_switch::emergency_disarm_windows_kill_switch` removes the WFP objects whether
// or not DNS could be restored, so the barrier is gone on every rung below; this ladder decides
// only what to do about the *resolver*.
//
// Rung 1 — exact restore, proven exactly as on the Disconnect path (`restore_protected`).
// Rung 2 — put the adapters Tono redirected back on **automatic (DHCP)**, both families, and
//          verify the machine is no longer resolving through the loopback core. DHCP is a
//          universally-correct resting state: the user gets working DNS from their network. It
//          is not their exact prior configuration, and at uninstall time — when the product is
//          being removed and connectivity matters more than fidelity — that is the right trade.
// Rung 3 — only when the machine is *provably* still on the loopback resolver, or when neither
//          the DHCP write nor the read-back produced any evidence at all. Then, and only then,
//          the refusal stands.
//
// None of this loosens the Disconnect / "Restore normal internet" path: `restore_protected`,
// `ensure_restored` and `disarm_unlocked` are untouched, and this ladder is reached only from
// the uninstaller's opt-in (`windows_kill_switch::uninstall_ladder_requested`).

/// Stable, App/installer-mappable marker for "the exact DNS restore could not be proven, so the
