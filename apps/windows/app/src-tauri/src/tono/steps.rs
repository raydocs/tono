//! Connect-transaction step records for the UI (F3).

//! Mirrors the §6 stage sequence into a serializable per-step state list:
//! an attempt starts from a fresh all-pending record, each `set_stage`
//! advance completes the previous step with its elapsed time and marks the

//! completed), and success completes them all. Pure, timing injected.
