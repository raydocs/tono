//! The user-initiated diagnostics report: assembly, scrubbing, whitelist.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! When a connect fails, the kill switch usually has the machine fully
//! network-blocked — but the WFP bootstrap policy deliberately keeps the
//! pinned API host IPs reachable on TCP/443 as a control-plane recovery
//! channel (`tono::bootstrap`), and the app's API client is pinned to those
//! same addresses (`tono::transport`). So an upload over the ordinary Tono
//! API transport succeeds *precisely* when the user has no other
//! connectivity, which is when the report is worth having.
//!
//! # Privacy posture (non-negotiable — this is a VPN)
//!
//! * The upload is **user-initiated only**. This module has no timer, no
//!   crash hook, and no background caller; the only entry points are the two
//!   Tauri commands the "Upload diagnostics" button drives.
//! * [`build_report`] is a **whitelist**. Every field is named by hand and
//!   copied from a specific source. No product struct is ever serialized
//!   wholesale, and there is no redact-and-hope blacklist pass over a blob.
//! * Free text (connect error, kill-switch/DNS `last_error`) is redacted a
//!   second time through the audit redactor *and* has IPv4 literals removed,
//!   because catalog node addresses are IPv4 literals by contract
//!   (`tono_core::node::ValidatedNode::server`) and could otherwise ride
//!   along inside an error message.
//! * Filesystem paths are scrubbed of the user's profile directory, so the
//!   Windows account name is not uploaded.
//!
//! Never uploaded, by construction (there is no field for them): the
//! generated runtime YAML or any part of it, the controller secret, node
//! UUIDs, Reality public keys / short ids, access or refresh tokens, the
//! Service owner token, and node IP addresses — including
//! `KillSwitchStatus::endpoints`, which is a list of node endpoints and is
//! deliberately *not* read here.
//!
//! # The Service's own log
//!
//! `C:\ProgramData\Tono\logs\tono-service.log` lives in a SYSTEM/Admins-only
//! directory, so the unprivileged app cannot read it. The report carries its
//! *path* only. Shipping its tail would need a new privileged IPC route and
//! is a deliberate follow-up, not part of this change.
